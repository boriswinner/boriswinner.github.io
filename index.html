	<h2>fpcCalc</h2>
	<img align="left" src="screencalc1.png" hspace="5"></img>
	<p>fpcCalc is a simple calculator program (partially clone of the one implemented in Windows 7) written using FreePascal and Lazarus IDE. Concieved as just a small homework, this project grew a little further: I added some features and licensed the program under GPLv3.
